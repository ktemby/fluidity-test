# fluidity-test
Simple OpenCV based fluidity testing tool

## Problem

When developing apps is nice to know the fluidity of animations and page transitions, but the tools between android and iOS can get a bit unweildy.

## Solution
As a lunchtime project I hacked some of the Eyesonhives code to create a fluidity tool.  Input video is just a screen recording from a phone, output video shows real time fluidity fps, overlaid to the original video so you can see ‘animations of interest’, or scroll through the output to whatever you wanted to examine.
